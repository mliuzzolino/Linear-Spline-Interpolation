# Linear-Spline-Interpolation

## Introduction
This script utilizes linear Lagrange Polynomials for interpolation using splines method. The interpolation values can be logged to a .csv file, and a dynamic graph enables the user to visualize the interpolating Lagrange polynomial along with the interpolation points of their choosing. 

The input data can be read from the /data/input directory. Currently, only .csv files can be read. Functionality for JSON will be incorporated in future iterations.
